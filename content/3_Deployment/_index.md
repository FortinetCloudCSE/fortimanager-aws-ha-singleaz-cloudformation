5.  On the Specify Details page, you will be prompted for a stack name and parameters for the deployment.  We are using the **'FortiManager_HA_singleaz_NewVPC.template.json'** template which deploys FMG into a new VPC's public subnets and gives options for configuring the instance settings.

6.  In the FortiManager Instance Configuration parameters section, we have selected an Instance Type and Key Pair to use, chose to encrypt both OS and Log disks, as well as Flex licensing.  Notice we are prompted for the licensing type which we are going with BYOL.  In our case we do not need to fill out the InitS3Bucket parameter.

7.  In the Interface IP Configuration for the FortiManager parameters section, we are going with the defaults in this example as the subnet addressing matches.  This IP will be the primary IP assigned to the FortiManager ENI.

8.  On the Options page, scroll down to the capabilities section.  As the template will create IAM resources, you need to acknowledge this by checking the box next to ‘I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources’ and then click Next.
